# Drone Scheduling Rules

A comprehensive library of constraint rules for drone scheduling optimization, including:

- Airport capability constraints (status, personnel workload, runway capacity, aircraft quantity)
- Aircraft capability constraints (type, payload, range, speed, maintenance)
- Task characteristic constraints (time window, sequence, priority)
- Geographical constraints (line of sight, position scoring, threat safety)
- Efficiency optimization rules (distance minimization, completion time minimization)

## Installation

```bash
pip install drone-scheduling-rules
